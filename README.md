# Green_Roof_Rainwater_Catchment_NYC
This code is a tool that can be used to quantify:
  1. The rainwater capture capacity of a green roof and
  2. The amount of rainwater available for capture through a rainwater harvesting system (with or without a green roof)
For a buidling in New York City given the size of the roof, the estimated absorption factor of the green roof (if applicable), and the estimate efficiency of the rainwater catchment system.
